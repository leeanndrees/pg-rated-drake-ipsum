##School-friendly Drake Ipsum
<b>If youâ€™re reading this set your type with [PG-rated] Drake.</b>

My high school HTML &amp; CSS students &hearts; filler text almost as much as they &hearts; Drake. This version of the brilliant [Drake Ipsum](http://drakeipsum.co) is for them to use in their projects without being _too_ wildly school-inappropriate.
